            <p className="text-start mb-2">{`I started my journey as a digital product designer, rubro/ambito that I very much enjoy. Iâ€™ve worked as a designer for one and a half year in TOQIO. Quickly, I started to get very interested in programming. I loved the process of building software not only ideating it.`}</p>

            <p className="text-start mb-2">{`I started studying programming, frontend development specifically and found out that in coding is where I found myself fullfilled.`}</p>

            <p className="text-start mb-2">{`Today, you can find me working at TOQIO, migrating from design to frontend team. `}</p>

            <p className="text-start mb-2">{`When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably doing ceramics or walking my dog.`}</p>
